Watched the stand-up meetings video on LinkedIn to have a understanding of what is going to be happening during my time with my team on our assignment and how i should be prepared for answering questions, as well as having the drive to complete tasks so no daily or weekly same problems as last time.

## Content Insights:
A standup meeting is to focus on quickly updating each other on their works and obstacles, they would usually stand in a small circle to keep the meeting shorter. While if the team agrees to sit down they would have a difficult time finishing the meeting. The team would discuss and talk about common questions; (What did i do yesterday?, What am I doing today?, Are there any obstacles in my way?). Only talk about specific tasks, don't talk about how you found a way you completed it. Don't drive the meetings let it flow even if it takes long then normal.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
While watching the video about how Stand-up meetings is usually done you can see that this allows for structure and organisation as each team member will have a base idea on how the progress is going and if anyone would need help if they are stuck one something for to long. Having either daily or weekly stand -up meetings would allow the progress of projects be more agile and the team would run more efficiently.
