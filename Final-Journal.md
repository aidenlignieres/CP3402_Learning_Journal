## Content Insights:
While searching for css styles that I couldn't remember so I tasked myself to do a quick revision on css as problems kept occuring which made me believe I was doing something wrong. I also notice that most people have little knowledge on aspects which some people exceed in for example video editing and recording, this is something most programmers would most likely never use but under certain situations having the basic understanding would allow for a more indepth understanding in how certain key aspect of a project could need such as doing online meetings and recording meetings.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
I had notice that it is best to revise on key coding languages which is most likely to be used thoughout working in the IT industry would help keep you up to data with any changes to the code language allowing for current or future work to be complete less stressfully. Also, I have notice that I have been leaning towards watching videos for learning new/old content as it gives a better understanding on what possibility could be achieved if you think outside the box and the possiblity to improve one content which I thought was good enough but wasn't.
