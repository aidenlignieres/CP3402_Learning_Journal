## Content Insights:
While interviewing there was questions which were too basic for asking and would only get a one word or sentence so while interviewing different people it was parimont to find a more suitable question which would allow more information to be given.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
By doing the group interviews this allowed the interviewer and interviewee to be able to think of potential questions to ask and answer allowing both to have a better understanding on how to answer any questions and ask questions in a real life job/intern/workplacement interview.
